Since registering this domain about 4 months ago and writing the first post about ClearSky, I did a lot of development and thinking what that would mean.</p><p>ClearSky is my side project. My free time to work on it is very limited. I was constantly struggling to minimize the scope of the project in order to maintain hope that it could one day be completed, or at least &ldquo;minimum viable product&rdquo;. The GUI was one of the first features to go. I figured a real devop&rsquo;er does&rsquo;t need a GUI right?</p><p>This weekend I saw <a href=https://coolify.io>coolify</a> on <a href=HackerNews>hackernews</a>. This was the moment I had secretly been hoping for: someone had the same idea AND lots of time. Coolify takes your github repo, builds it and hosts the result. It even has a slick webinterface.</p><p>As always, there are still a lot of features that i would like to have. Maybe the most important one is backups. Coolify can deploy databases and services like minio for you. These store data in docker volumes. I need something that will let me periodically backup all these databases and volumes. Sure, I can write some scripts to do it, but it would be nice if that was integrated in the product.</p><p>Another optimalization that i would like to see is shared database servers. I don&rsquo;t need 10 postgres instances to host 10 databases. 1 instance is enough. Databases are more than capable of handling authentication and authorization of different users.</p><p>While there is definitely room for improvement, coolify comes closer to what I envisioned for ClearSky than anything I&rsquo;ve seen so far. So I decided to stop working on the ClearSky platform for now, and see what cool things I can build on coolify. This blog is now hosted on coolify as well.</p></article></main><script async defer data-website-id=1c1c8489-4fb2-4940-af2a-09eca940adb1 src=https://analytics.clearsky.dev/umami.js></script></body></html>
